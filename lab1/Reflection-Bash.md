# Bash vs Java Reflection

This lab exercise marked my first time programming in Bash. I was not able to recreate the same features as the ones in my Java program. This was mostly due to the fact that I spent a lot of time reading documentation and other people’s code to understand the basics of bash and date functions. It took me a while to figure out that the date functions were different on macOS, so I was running into many errors at the beginning of the process. I wasn’t able to parse user input in the formats on step 3, so I kept the working program that didn’t include this. However, I’d like to tackle this again soon. 

The concept of handling user input was similar to that of Java, though shorter because you don’t have to create a scanner and declare variables for the input separately from taking them in. I only needed two lines of code on bash to accept user input. The date handling is very different since on Java I used LocalDate which has its own functions. The code for doing calculations with the dates was much shorter on bash. 

Due to my lack of experience in programming with Bash, I wasn’t aware of any libraries to use in my program. However, if I had more time, I’d research Date libraries for macOS so I could handle custom date inputs from the user.
